## What is this?

[nkd.su](http://nkd.su) is a request-gathering and voting service for [The
Cat](http://thisisthecat.com)'s [Neko
Desu](http://www.thisisthecat.com/index.php/neko-desu) radio show. Songs are
sorted on the front page according to how many votes they have recieved.

### How do I vote?

If there are any songs on the front page you would like to vote for, click on
the song title and send the generated tweet. If nothing on the front page
strikes your fancy, feel free to use the search box provided to find something
more your style. Once you've found something, click the title.

None of your Twitter followers will see your vote unless 
they're also following [@nkdsu](http://twitter.com/nkdsu).

Any text added to the vote tweet after the number will appear after your name when
people mouse-over your user icon.

You may only submit one vote per song per week and all votes are reset at 11pm
on Saturday, at the end of the show.

### When can I vote?

As long as the track you wish to vote for has not been played either last week
or during the show currently airing and you have not already voted for it, your
vote will be accepted. There are no other limitations.
